# Netdata unlock more than 5 nodes

Project was created after this rant: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1i7msq3/netdata_you_can_now_view_5_nodes_at_a_time_unless/?rdt=37893

Basically, in the endpoint that limit the number of nodes that can be used. It returns all the registered nodes instead of only the ones that you had to choose in the "Review your Space active Nodes".

This allows to choose more than 5 nodes or any node that you want in your dashboard.

# Prerequisites

Make sure to select at least 5 nodes in the nodes selector in the netdata web interface. Otherwise, the program will not work.
